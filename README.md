# myspectre.css
lightweight, responsive and modern CSS framework based on spectre.css

myspectre.css is framework css based on [Spectre](http://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/)

This version uses a instanced version of the framework, designed on material-design.
The colors and animations, well-done on this style, are extracted from the proposed framework [W3.CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp) by Refsnes Data.  

But most important is the light javascript code that simply allows you to attach listeners on events of html-tag using the inline-definition ( example: onclick="open_menu(this);" )

##Documentation
The documentation of the framework is coming soon...
